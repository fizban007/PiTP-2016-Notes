#PiTP 2016 Computational Plasma Astrophysics
===========================================

This repository is my attempt at recording notes for the
[2016 PiTP summer school](https://pitp.ias.edu/) at IAS, Princeton. I type the
notes during the lecture and record/summarize what the lecturer is saying as
much as I physically can.

Disclaimer: The notes are taken during the lecture and are very rough, may
contain typos, misunderstandings, bugs, lethal substance, etc. Use at your own
risk. However if you spot a typo or serious misunderstanding please send me an
email or simply a pull request. I'll really appreciate it!

Disclaimer 2: These notes are not intended to replace the original notes/slides
from the speakers! I like to read these and the original notes/slides together
to get a better idea what happened during the lecture.

Comment/Rant: It's so much harder to take notes when the speaker uses slides,
than when he uses chalk & board. The slides runs by so fast that there is
almost no time to write down the equations...
