#PiTP 2016 Computational Plasma Astrophysics
===========================================

This repository is my attempt at recording notes for the
[2016 PiTP summer school](https://pitp.ias.edu/) at IAS, Princeton.

Disclaimer: The notes are taken during the lecture and are very rough, may
contain typos, misunderstandings, bugs, lethal substance, etc. Use at your own
risk. However if you spot a typo or serious misunderstanding please send me an
email or simply a pull request. I'll really appreciate it!

Disclaimer 2: These notes are not intended to replace the original notes/slides
from the speakers! I like to read these and the original notes/slides together
to get a better idea what happened during the lecture.
