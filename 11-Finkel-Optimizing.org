* Optimizing for HPC
** What optimization means
In practice high-level optimization is usually not very useful. One need to use
the knowledge of the system architecture and tools when one chooses algorithms
and when optimizing. 

Traditional computers are built to move data around, make decisions, and compute
relatively low order polynomials.
